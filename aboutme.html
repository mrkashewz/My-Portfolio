    <p>
      For as long as I can remember, art has always played a huge role in my life. I used to get into trouble in elementary school for doodling instead of taking notes in class. Later in high school and college, I took many art classes and improved on my skills. It was only half way through college career that I decided to pursue my passion for creating visual designs and switched my major from Business Administration to Graphic/ Web Design.

        Starting in high school I became fascinated with spiritual practices such as meditation (which I still do every morning). It was only until a couple of years later in college that I decided to try a yoga class out after my gym had closed down temporarily due to a flood. Immediately I was captivated by the calming but refreshing side effects of a yoga class. The next day, I cancelled my gym membership and started a yoga membership. The next month, I signed up for a 9-month long yoga teaching training course which I completed and have been teaching ever since!

        I’m also obsessed with tea! More specifically I enjoy Chinese style loose leaf teas, after I spent a year working in a tea store in the heart of San Francisco’s Chinatown neighborhood. The experience not only taught me how to make a killer cup of tea but also how to thrive in fast paced work environments. If you like what you've seen and want to chat, feel free to get in touch!
